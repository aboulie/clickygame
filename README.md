# Sergei Eisenstein Clicky Game (Memory Game using React)

View the completed app on Heroku <a href="http://bit.ly/roseclickygame">here</a>

Clicky Game is an app that lets you attempt to choose a scene from one of Eisenstein's films without choosing the same scene twice. After the player chooses a scene, the scene cards are shuffled and then the player can choose again. If the player chooses a scene that has previously been chosen, the game ends and the player may start over. If a score is higher than a previous one, then the new score is entered into high score in the Nav bar. 

For this app, the UI was broken into various components, and using React allows for the management of component state and responsiveness to user events.
